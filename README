## Repository Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Keyboard_Disabler/** | Demonstrates USB keyboard-emulation behavior. Useful for experimenting with HID scripting, keystroke automation and device interaction testing. |
| **Persistance Notes by Vibes/** | Contains personal notes related to persistence behavior, device state, and Digispark boot cycles. |
| **Rickroll/** | A fun micro-payload example that automates opening a Rickroll link or similar action. Great to learn USB keystroke sequences. |
| **Template_Wifi/** | Starting template for using Digispark alongside external Wi-Fi modules. Includes boilerplate code and setup references. |
| **Notes by Vibe.exh.txt** | Additional notes, references, and thoughts related to these projects. |
